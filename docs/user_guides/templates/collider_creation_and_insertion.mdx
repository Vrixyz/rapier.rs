A collider is created by a `ColliderBuilder` structure that is based on the builder pattern. Then it needs
to be inserted into the `ColliderSet` that will be processed by the physics-pipeline, collision-pipeline, or
query-pipeline.

:::info
The following example shows several setters that can be called to customize the
collider being built. The input values are just random so using this example as-is will not
lead to a useful result.

A collider is created by adding the `Collider` component. Other components like `Transform`,
`Sensor`, `Friction`, etc. can be added to customize the collider.

A collider can optionally be attached to a rigid-body. Attaching a collider to a rigid-body will result in the
rigid-body being affected by collisions. The collider's position will be automatically updated from the position
of the rigid-body it is attached to. There are two ways of attaching a collider to a rigid-body. The second
way allows you to attach multiple colliders to the same rigid-body:
1. Attach the `Collider` to the same entity as the `RigidBody`.
2. Attach the `Collider` to an entity that is a children of the entity containing the `RigidBody`.

<load path='/2d/bevy/examples/colliders2.rs' marker='Creation2' />

A collider is created by a `World.createCollider` method. The initial state of
the collider to create is described by an instance of the `ColliderDesc` class.

Each collider create by the physics world is given an integer identifier. This identifier
is guaranteed to the different from any identifier of colliders still existing in the physics
world. However, the identifier may be equal to the identifier of an older collider that has
already been removed from the physics world with `World.removeCollider`.
