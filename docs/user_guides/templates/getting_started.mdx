## Setting up Rapier with Cargo
**rapier** relies on the official Rust package manager
[Cargo](https://crates.io) for dependency resolution and compilation. Therefore,
making **rapier** ready to use in your project is simply a matter of
adding a new dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file. You can either use the [**rapier2d**
crate](https://crates.io/crates/rapier2d) for 2D physics simulation or the [**rapier3d** crate](https://crates.io/crates/rapier3d)
for 3D physics simulation. For high-precision simulation using 64-bits floats, use the [**rapier2d-f64**
crate](https://crates.io/crates/rapier2d-f64) or the [**rapier3d-f64** crate](https://crates.io/crates/rapier3d-f64).

Until **rapier** reaches 1.0, it is strongly recommended to always use its
latest published version, though you may encounter breaking changes from time to time.

To get the best of **rapier** multiple features can be enabled optionally:
- `simd-stable`: enables explicit SIMD optimizations using the [`wide` crate](https://crates.io/crates/wide).
Has limited cross-platform support but can be used with a stable version of the Rust compiler.
- `simd-nightly`: enables explicit SIMD optimizations using the [`packed_simd` crate](https://crates.io/crates/packed_simd).
Has a great cross-platform support but requires a nightly version of the Rust compiler.
- `parallel`: enables parallelism of the physics pipeline with the [`rayon` crate](https://crates.io/crates/rayon).
- `serde-serialize`: enables serialization of the physics components with [`serde`](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde).
- `enhanced-determinism`: enables cross-platform determinism (assuming the rest of your code is also deterministic) across
  all 32-bit and 64-bit platforms that implements the
 IEEE 754-2008 standard strictly. This includes most modern processors as well as WASM targets.
- `wasm-bindgen`: enables usage of `rapier` as a dependency of a WASM crate that is compiled with `wasm-bindgen`.

:::warning
Enabling parallelism is only useful if the scene being simulated has a high number of moving rigid-bodies, colliders,
and/or joints. If the simulation isn't sufficiently complex, the parallelism may actually make the simulation slower
because of the parallelism overhead.
:::

Currently, the `enhanced-determinism` feature cannot be enabled at the same time as the `parallel` or
`simd-{stable,nightly}` features.

## Basic simulation example

Here is a basic example of `main.rs` file. This creates a ball bouncing on a fixed ground. Details about the
elements used in this examples are given in subsequent pages of this guide.
