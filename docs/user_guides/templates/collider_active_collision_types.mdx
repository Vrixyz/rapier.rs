By default, collision-detection is completely disabled between two colliders when both are attached to non-dynamic bodies.
Sometimes, it can be useful to enable collision-detection between, e.g., a collider attached to a kinematic rigid-body
and a collider attached to a fixed rigid-body. This can be done by modifying the collider's `ActiveCollisionTypes`:

<rapier>

```rust
<load path='/2d/rust/examples/rs_colliders2.rs' marker='ActiveCollisionTypes1' />
```
```rust
<load path='/2d/rust/examples/rs_colliders2.rs' marker='ActiveCollisionTypes2' />
```

</rapier>

```rust
<load path='/2d/bevy/examples/colliders2.rs' marker='ActiveCollisionTypes1' />
```
```rust
<load path='/2d/bevy/examples/colliders2.rs' marker='ActiveCollisionTypes2' />
```

</bevy>
<js>

```js
<load path='/2d/javascript/src/snippets/colliders.ts' marker='ActiveCollisionTypes1' />
```
```js
<load path='/2d/javascript/src/snippets/colliders.ts' marker='ActiveCollisionTypes2' />
```

</js>

:::info
To enable collision-detection between kinematic bodies and fixed bodies (as well as dynamic bodies),
set its active collision types to:

<notjs>

```rust
ActiveCollisionTypes::default() | ActiveCollisionTypes::KINEMATIC_FIXED
```

</notjs>

<js>

```js
RAPIER.ActiveCollisionTypes.DEFAULT | RAPIER.ActiveCollisionTypes.KINEMATIC_FIXED
```

</js>
