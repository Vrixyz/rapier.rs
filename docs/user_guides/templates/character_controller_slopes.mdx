If sliding is enabled, the character can automatically climb slopes if they are not too steep, or slide down slopes if
they are too steep. Sliding is configured by the following parameters:
- The **max slope climb angle**: if the angle between the slope to climb and the horizontal floor is larger than this
value, then the character won’t be able to slide up this slope.
- The **min slope slide angle**: if the angle between the slope and the horizontal floor is smaller than this value,
then the vertical component of the character’s movement won’t result in any sliding.

As always in Rapier, angles are specified in radians.
