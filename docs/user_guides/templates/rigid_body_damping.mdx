Damping lets you slow down a rigid-body automatically. This can be used to achieve a wide variety of effects like
fake air friction. Each rigid-body is given a **linear damping coefficient** (affecting its linear velocity) and an
**angular damping coefficient** (affecting its angular velocity). Larger values of the damping coefficients lead to
a stronger slow-downs. Their default values are `0.0` (no damping at all).


This damping coefficients can be set when the rigid-body is created or after its creation:

```js
/* Set the damping coefficients when the rigid-body is created. */
let rigidBodyDesc = RAPIER.RigidBodyDesc.dynamic()
    .setLinearDamping(0.5)
    .setAngularDamping(1.0);
let rigidBody = world.createRigidBody(rigidBodyDesc);
```
```js
/* Set the damping coefficients after the rigid-body creation. */
rigidBody.setLinearDamping(0.5);
rigidBody.setAngularDamping(1.0);
```
